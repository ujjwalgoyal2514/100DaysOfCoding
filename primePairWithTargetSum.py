"""Given a number n, find out if n can be expressed as a+b, where both a and b are prime numbers. If such a pair exists, return the values of a and b, otherwise return [-1,-1] as an array of size 2.
Note: If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, and a < c then  [a, b] is considered as our answer.

Examples

Input: n = 10
Output: 3 7
Explanation: There are two possiblities 3, 7 & 5, 5 are both prime & their sum is 10, but we'll pick 3, 7 as 3 < 5.
Input: n = 3
Output: -1 -1
Explanation: There are no solutions to the number 3.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n*loglog(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
2 <= n <= 106
