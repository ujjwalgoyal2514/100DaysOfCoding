"""Given a weighted tree with n nodes and (n-1) edges. You are given q queries. Each query contains a number x. For each query, find the number of paths in which the maximum edge weight is less than or equal to x.

Note: Path from A to B and B to A are considered to be the same.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 3
edges {start, end, weight} = {{1, 2, 1}, {2, 3, 4}}
q = 1
queries[] = {3}
Output: 
1
Explanation:
Query 1: Path from 1 to 2
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 7
edges {start, end, weight} = {{1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, {2, 4, 9}, {3, 6, 7}, {3, 5, 8}, {5, 7, 4}}
q = 3
queries[] = {1, 3, 5}
Output: 
1 3 4
Explanation: 
Query 1: Path from 2 to 3
Query 2: Path from 1 to 2, 1 to 3, and 2 to 3
Query 3: Path from 1 to 2, 1 to 3, 2 to 3, and 5 to 7
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maximumWeight()which takes integers n, list of edges where each edge is given by {start,end,weight}, an integer q and a list of q queries as input parameters and returns a list of integers denoting the number of possible paths for each query. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn + qlogn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
